Javet
=====

Javet is Java + V8 (JAVa + V + EighT). It is yet another way of embedding V8 in Java. It was inspired by J2V8. I'll try to keep up with latest V8 in a slow pace. If you like my work, please **Star** this project. And, you may send messages to `@sjtucaocao <https://twitter.com/sjtucaocao>`_.

Please refer to `History with J2V8 <docs/history_with_j2v8.rst>`_ for detail.

Well, Why not Let Me Start from Scratch?
========================================

Sometimes starting from scratch implies lower cost than upgrading an existing solution. I think it might be true here in this project. I've learned quite a lot by manually fixing the Windows and Linux build system.

Also, I've got many ideas on how the API will look like. I think I would be able to write a new one from scratch and leave J2V8 behind.
