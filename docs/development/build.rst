Build Javet
===========

It's quite hard for developers to build Javet successfully for various reasons.

* Node.js needs to be built to static libraries.
* V8 needs to be built to monolith.
* Every OS platform has its own pitfalls which usually make developers frustrated, or even desperate.

Here are 3 ways of building Javet.

1. `Build Javet with Docker <build_javet_with_docker.rst>`_ (Linux and Windows)
2. `Build Javet with Pre-built Binaries <build_javet_with_pre_built_binaries.rst>`_ (Linux, Mac OS and Windows)
3. `Build Javet from Scratch <build_javet_from_scratch.rst>`_ (Linux, Mac OS and Windows)
