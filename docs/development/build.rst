Build Javet
===========

It's quite hard for developers to build Javet successfully for various reasons.

* Node.js needs to be built to static libraries.
* V8 needs to be built to monolith.
* Every OS platform has its own pitfalls which usually make developers frustrated, or even desperate.

Here are 3 ways of building Javet.
