Development Tools
=================

JDK
===

Javet development requires JDK 8 to be installed, though Javet supports JDK 8+. JDK 6 support has been dropped because a few JDK 8 features are heavily used in Javet.

IntelliJ
========

I personally recommend IntelliJ IDEA.

Gradle
======

For now, Gradle v6.7 + Kotlin DSL constructs the build system.

Maven (Optional)
================

Maven v3.6.3+ is used for packaging bundle to maven central.

Visual Studio Community 2019 (Optional)
=======================================

Visual Studio Community 2019 is used for JNI development.

Python 3.8+ (Optional)
======================

Python 3.8+ is required if you want to upgrade the version.

NodeJS (Optional)
=================

NodeJS 14.5+ is required if you want to go over the tutorial because a few examples use some node modules. After installing NodeJS, please visit ``scripts/node`` directory and run ``npm install``.
