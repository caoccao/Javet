Can Javet Support Mac?
======================

Short answer is **Yes and No**.

Yes
===

There is no technical difficulties. The code is written in cross-platform manner. Someone needs to pay considerable effort creating and maintaining the Mac build.

No

I don't own a decent Mac device. To be more precisely, I have Mac Mini and MacBook Air, but they are too old (building Node.js and V8 would take many hours). Besides, there are both x86 and arm64 to be supported.

I have no plan on buying 2 new Mac devices for supporting Javet only in the near future. If I could be well funded, I would consider supporting Mac.
