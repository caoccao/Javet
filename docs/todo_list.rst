TODO List
=========

* To start from scratch so that there is no legal issues to J2V8.
* To implement V8 runtime pool like DB connection pool. The performance test shows there is a huge gap (millions vs. hundreds) between pooled and non-pooled V8 runtime.
* To support more types that are not supported by ECMAScript, e.g. BigDecimal, etc.
* To revive NodeJS.
* To implement runtime debugging capability.
