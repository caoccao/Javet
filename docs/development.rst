Development Tools
=================

JDK
---

Javet development requires JDK 8 to be installed, though Javet supports JDK 8+. JDK 6 support has been dropped because a few JDK 8 features are heavily used in Javet.

IDE
---

I personally recommend IntelliJ IDEA.

Gradle
------

For now, Gradle v6.7 + Kotlin DSL constructs the build system.
