Javet Development

Development Tools
=================

JDK
---

Javet development requires JDK 8 to be installed, though Javet supports JDK 8+. JDK 6 support has been dropped because a few JDK 8 features are heavily used in Javet.

IDE
---

I personally recommend IntelliJ IDEA.

Gradle
------

For now, Gradle v6.7 + Kotlin DSL constructs the build system.

Maven
-----

Maven v3.6.3+ is the one.

Python 3.8+ (Optional)
----------------------

Python 3.8+ is required if you want to upgrade the version.

NodeJS (Optional)
-----------------

NodeJS 14.5+ is required if you want to go over the tutorial because a few examples use some node modules. After installing NodeJS, please visit ``scripts/node`` directory and run ``npm install``.
